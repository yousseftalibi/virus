connectivity percentages: 
type decimal
represent how connected each percentage of the agents to the network.
input values range from 0.0 to 1.0, total has to sum to 1.0. 
values are: (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8)

Example: 
0.2 on the first input field corresponds to 20% of the agents have a value of 0.2 in connectivity.
0.5 on the second input field corresponds to 50% of the agents have a value of 0.4 in connectivity.
0.2 on the third input field corresponds to 20% of the agents have a value of 0.6 in connectivity.
0.1 on the fourth input field corresponds to 10% of the agents have a value of 0.8 in connectivity.



experience percentages: 
type decimal
represent how experienced each percentage of the agents users are.
input values range from 0.0 to 1.0, total has to sum to 1.0. 
values are: (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8)

Example: 
0.2 on the first input field corresponds to 20% of the users have a value of 0.2 in experience.
0.5 on the second input field corresponds to 50% of the agents have a value of 0.4 in experience.
0.2 on the third input field corresponds to 20% of the agents have a value of 0.6 in experience.
